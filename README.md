This project is driven by the pressing need to fortify data security in our digital age, characterized by 
an escalating volume of sensitive information and an ever-expanding array of cyber threats. In 
response to the imperative for a robust defense mechanism, the project aims to integrate dual 
encryption using the formidable RSA and AES algorithms. By synergizing the asymmetric strength 
of RSA with the symmetric efficiency of AES, our objective is to provide a comprehensive solution 
for secure local file storage and confidential communication. The motivation lies in empowering 
users with a cutting-edge, adaptable, and resilient data protection mechanism that not only anticipates 
and mitigates current threats but also stands ready to confront the evolving challenges of tomorrow, 
ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information in the dynamic and often 
treacherous digital landscape
In the realm of cybersecurity, the demand for robust data protection mechanisms continues to grow. 
This project addresses this imperative by introducing a comprehensive dual encryption system, 
fusing the strengths of RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) 
algorithms. The project encompasses two distinct applications: secure file storage and confidential 
communication. The first application focuses on secure file storage, where selected files undergo 
dual encryption. Initially, the chosen file is encrypted using the AES algorithm, ensuring a formidable 
level of data protection. Subsequently, the AES key used in the encryption process is further 
encrypted using RSA, adding an additional layer of security. The encrypted file and the RSAencrypted AES key are then stored, guaranteeing a robust and layered defense against unauthorized 
access. The second application introduces a secure chat system employing dual encryption for both 
text messages and file transfers. Messages are encrypted using RSA, ensuring confidentiality during 
communication. For file transfers, an AES key is used to encrypt the file, and this key is then 
encrypted using RSA before being transmitted. The recipient decrypts the RSA-encrypted AES key 
to obtain the necessary key for decrypting the received file, thereby establishing a secure and private 
file exchange protocol. The project utilizes state-of-the-art cryptographic tools and libraries to 
implement these dual encryption mechanisms. Results indicate the successful implementation of 
secure storage and communication, providing users with a heightened level of data security. The 
challenges faced during implementation are discussed, along with their resolutions. This project not 
only showcases the efficacy of dual encryption but also opens avenues for future research and 
improvement in the domain of data security. The integration of RSA and AES in both local file 
storage and secure communication applications presents a comprehensive solution to the everevolving challenges of data protection in the digital age
